A variable is a named object. An object is a region in memory that
stores some data.

*Defining variable:* The statement that denines a variable is called
a /definition/. A definition can also provide an initial value. For
example,

#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>
std::string name = "Venkatesh Jatla";
int my_num = 369;
std::cout << my_num;
#+end_src
