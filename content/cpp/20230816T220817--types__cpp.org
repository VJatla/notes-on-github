* Introduction
The places in which we store data are called /objects/. To access an
object we need a /name/. A named object is called a /variable/ and
has a specific *type* (such as ~int~ and ~string~).

The *type* determines what can be put into the object and which
operations can be applied. Each of the type have their own
characteristic style of  [[file:20230816T224346--literals__cpp.org][literals]].

For example, 
- ~123~ is an integer. We can perform multiplicaiton using =*= operator
  on integers.
- ~"Hello, World!\n"~ is a string and we can use ~<=~ to compare them.

* Important Types
